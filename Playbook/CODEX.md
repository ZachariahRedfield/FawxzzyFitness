# CODEX.md

Repository operating contract.

## Governance
- If `docs/AGENT.md` exists, follow it.
- If `CODEX.md` exists, follow it.
- If `docs/CHANGELOG.md` exists, update it with concise **WHAT + WHY** for non-trivial changes.

## Working style
- Keep docs modular and skimmable.
- Do not invent facts; mark gaps as `TODO`.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes.
