# AGENT.md

Agent rules for this repository.

## Non-negotiables
- Treat source dumps as source-of-truth.
- Do not fabricate implementation details; use `TODO` where evidence is missing.
- Keep distilled guidance generic and reusable; avoid domain-specific nouns unless explicitly labeled as an example.
- Every principle, pattern, and checklist item must include source attribution.
- Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` using **WHAT + WHY** for meaningful updates.

## Documentation style
- Prefer concise headings and bullets.
- Keep each document focused on one concern.
- Link new/updated docs from `docs/INDEX.md`.
