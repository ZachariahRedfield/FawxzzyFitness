# Exercise Icons

Drop square exercise icon files in this folder.

PNG exercise files are preferred in the app. If a file is missing (or fails to load), the ExercisePicker falls back to an inline SVG archetype icon so tiles are never empty.

- Recommended sizes: **48x48** or **96x96**.
- Preferred formats: **.png** or **.webp** (`.svg` also works).
- Naming convention: `<exercise_slug>.png` (or `.webp`).

Examples:

- `/public/exercise-icons/back-squat.png`
- `/public/exercise-icons/barbell-bench-press.png`
