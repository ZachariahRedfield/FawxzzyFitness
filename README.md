# Product Engineering Playbook

This repository is a long-term, evolving playbook for product engineering execution: clear principles, reusable architecture patterns, actionable checklists, and copy/paste templates and prompts to help ship faster with less risk.

## Quickstart

Use the bootstrap prompt: [`docs/PROMPTS/codex-new-project-bootstrap.md`](docs/PROMPTS/codex-new-project-bootstrap.md).

Then start from the table of contents: [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md).

## Contributing to my own playbook

Rule: every lesson becomes a tiny PR (5–15 lines) so improvements stay frequent, focused, and easy to review.
