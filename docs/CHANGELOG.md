# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Session history now records a session name and routine day snapshot so past workouts keep human-readable context even if routine templates change.
- Session logging now supports optional per-set time (seconds) and exercise-level skip state for faster real-world tracking flexibility.
- Routine template system with configurable cycle length, per-user timezone support, active routine selection, and routine/day exercise management so users can run repeatable plans without manual daily setup.
- Project documentation (PROJECT.md, AGENT.md, ENGINE.md).
- Initial vertical slice (auth, sessions, sets, history).

### Changed
- Routine setup/edit now uses preset IANA timezone dropdown choices to reduce input errors while preserving timezone-aware scheduling.
- Routine templates now use target sets + target reps instead of rep ranges to match the app's deterministic workout planning style.
- Today now resolves the correct routine day from timezone-aware date math and routine start date so training day selection stays deterministic across locales.
- Start Session now seeds today's template exercises immediately and session logging supports add/remove exercise during a live workout.
- History now shows session name, routine day snapshot, and performed timestamp for quicker scan of past training days.

### Fixed
- Routine cards no longer show the extra start-date/timezone subtitle line, reducing visual noise on the routines list.
- Routine-day exercise editing now uses a controlled UUID exercise picker and inserts `routine_day_exercises` with authenticated `user_id` + selected `routine_day_id`, so adding exercises saves reliably instead of failing on invalid free-text IDs.
- Today + Start Session now derive routine context from `profiles.active_routine_id` on the server, recompute the current day index, and persist `sessions.routine_id` + `sessions.routine_day_index` before seeding `session_exercises`, so session rows keep routine linkage and template exercises are consistently preloaded.
- Routine edit and Today now surface server action error messages inline, so users can see the real failure reason and recover quickly.
- Routine activation now uses `profiles.active_routine_id` as the only source of truth so Today and Routines stay in sync immediately after switching active routine.
- Protected page loads now ensure a profile exists (timezone + active routine pointer) so routine logic always has required user settings data.
- Today routine-day resolution now consistently uses the profile timezone and safe modulo day math (including future start dates) so the selected template day is deterministic.
- Routine cycle-length edits now safely resize day rows (add missing days, remove overflow days, preserve kept days) so template history remains stable while plans evolve.
- Email verification links now redirect to login with verified state and prefilled email instead of landing on an error page.
- Server/client boundary violations causing runtime crash.
- Middleware matcher exclusions.
- Environment variable handling.

### Notes
- Manual test checklist: login → routines (create/select active) → today (verify day name/exercises) → Start Session (verify seeded exercise order) → edit routine cycle length up/down → switch active routine and confirm Today updates immediately.
