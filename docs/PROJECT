# Fawxzzy Fitness
Minimalist Gym Progression Engine

## Vision
A mobile-first progression engine for serious lifters who hate bloated fitness apps.

User chooses what to train.
The app tells them how to beat last time.

No fluff. No social feed. No opaque AI.

---

## Product Priorities (Ordered)

1. Simplicity & Speed
2. Automatic Push (recommended weight + reps)
3. Clear Proof of Growth
4. Transparent Logic (deterministic, not black-box)

---

## Core Experience

Open → See Today → Lift → Log Fast → Get Summary → Leave.

---

## Differentiation

- Per-exercise "last time" comparison
- Deterministic progression logic
- User-selectable aggressiveness (Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive)
- Internal metrics (e.g. tonnage) used for logic only — not exposed

---

## Non-Goals (Protect Against Scope Creep)

- No social features
- No community leaderboards
- No influencer tools
- No generic auto-generated workouts
- No advanced periodization modeling (v1)
- No gamified streak gimmicks
- No raw tonnage dashboards

---

## Technical Principles

- Next.js App Router
- Supabase (Auth + Postgres + RLS)
- PWA, mobile-first
- Offline-capable logging (future)
- Templates separate from session history
- All user data secured via RLS

---

## v1 Definition of Done

- Auth works
- Start Session works
- Log sets works
- History works
- No crashes
- Loads fast on phone
