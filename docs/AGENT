# AGENT RULES – Fawxzzy Fitness

Before making any non-trivial change:

1. Read:
   - docs/PROJECT.md
   - docs/ENGINE.md (when added)
   - docs/CHANGELOG.md

Assume these define constraints.

Do not introduce changes that conflict with product priorities.

---

## Architectural Intent

Treat this as a clean, scalable monolith.

Rules:
- Do not mix server-only code into client components.
- Browser Supabase client must never import server utilities.
- All user-owned rows must include user_id.
- All Supabase tables must enforce RLS.

---

## Progression Philosophy

Deterministic.
Reps first, then weight.
User-selectable aggressiveness.
No black-box AI.

Internal metrics may inform decisions but must not create opaque behavior.

---

## Changelog Discipline

For any merge-worthy change:
- Add concise entry to docs/CHANGELOG.md.
- Summarize WHAT changed and WHY.
- Keep entries short and factual.
- Do not write narrative history.

---

## Code Quality Rules

- Keep files small.
- Avoid unnecessary libraries.
- No premature abstractions.
- Optimize for clarity and speed.
- Validate inputs minimally.
- No dead code.

---

## Deployment Safety

- Never expose Supabase service role key.
- Only use anon key in frontend.
- Do not enable static export.
- Auth pages must be dynamic.

---

## Done Criteria

A change is complete only if:
- It builds successfully.
- It runs locally.
- It deploys successfully on Vercel.
- No client-side runtime crashes.
