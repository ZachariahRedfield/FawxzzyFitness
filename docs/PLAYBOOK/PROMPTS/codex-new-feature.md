# Codex Prompt: New Feature

Implement a new feature in this repo.

Requirements:
- Follow `CODEX.md` and `docs/AGENT.md`.
- Respect product priorities in `docs/PROJECT.md` and progression constraints in `docs/ENGINE.md`.
- Reuse conventions in `docs/PLAYBOOK/CONVENTIONS.md` and relevant pattern docs.
- Do not introduce server/client boundary violations.
- If data is user-owned, keep `user_id` + RLS expectations intact.
- Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with WHAT + WHY.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.
- Summarize changed files and test commands.
