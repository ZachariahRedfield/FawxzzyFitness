# Fawxzzy Fitness
Minimalist Gym Progression Engine

## Vision
A mobile-first progression engine for serious lifters who hate bloated fitness apps.

User chooses what to train.
The app tells them how to beat last time.

No fluff. No social feed. No opaque AI.

## Product Priorities (Ordered)

1. Simplicity & Speed
2. Automatic Push (recommended weight + reps)
3. Clear Proof of Growth
4. Transparent Logic (deterministic, not black-box)

## Core Experience

Open → See Today → Lift → Log Fast → Get Summary → Leave.

---

## Non-Goals

- No leaderboards
- No influencer features
- No generic auto-generated workouts
- No gamified streak systems
- No raw tonnage dashboards

---

## v1 Definition of Done

- Auth works
- Start Session works
- Log sets works
- History works
- No runtime crashes
