# Project Governance

This repository is governed by the Product Engineering Playbook.

Source of truth:
https://github.com/ZachariahRedfield/Playbook

## Rules for Codex / Agents

1. Follow the central Playbook principles and patterns.
2. Follow local docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for project-specific structure.
3. Update docs/CHANGELOG.md (WHAT + WHY) for all non-trivial changes.
4. Capture reusable learnings:
   - If a change introduces a reusable pattern, guardrail, failure mode, or decision:
     - Add an entry to docs/PLAYBOOK_NOTES.md (see format below)
     - Include a brief “Playbook Impact” section in your output (optional but preferred)

## Documentation Scope in This Repo

Allowed documentation files:
- docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/CHANGELOG.md
- docs/PLAYBOOK_NOTES.md

All reusable patterns, templates, prompts, and checklists live in the central Playbook repository.
